# RC High-Pass (Subsonic) Filter PCB

A simple, single-pole (6 dB/oct) RC **high-pass** filter PCB designed in EasyEDA, intended for subwoofer or full-range signal protection by removing unwanted low-frequency content (subsonic).  
Current configuration is tuned for ~33.9 Hz when used with a high-impedance amplifier input.

## 📌 Purpose

This board filters out **very low frequencies** that can cause:
- Woofer over-excursion below enclosure tuning (e.g., in bandpass boxes like the Hexibase 7th-order design)
- Wasted amplifier power on inaudible bass
- Distortion and muddiness in low-end playback

Typical application:
- Place between **AVR sub-out** and **power amplifier**.
- Example setup: AVR151 → Sub out → **This filter** → TPA3116D2 amp → Parallel 8 Ω subs (4 Ω total).

## ⚙️ How It Works

This is a **1st-order passive RC high-pass filter**:
- **C2** in series with signal  
- **R2** to ground after C2  
- **R1** (bleed resistor) to ground before C2 — prevents DC build-up and input pops.

**Cutoff frequency formula**:
\[
f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R_{\text{eff}} C}
\]
Where:
- \(C\) = series capacitor value (C2)
- \(R_{\text{eff}}\) = R2 in parallel with amplifier input impedance

## 🔧 Current Build (as per PCB design)

| Component | Value     | Notes                                    |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| R1        | 100 kΩ    | Bleed resistor, 1% metal film, through-hole |
| R2        | 10 kΩ     | Shunt resistor, 1% metal film, through-hole |
| C2        | 0.47 µF   | Film capacitor, ±5%, through-hole        |

**Expected cutoff**: ~33.9 Hz with high-Z amp input (~100 kΩ).  
If amp Rin = 47 kΩ → ~41 Hz.  
If amp Rin = 20 kΩ → ~50.8 Hz.

## 🎯 Retuning for Different Frequencies

**Method 1: Keep R2 fixed, change C2**
\[
C2 = \frac{1}{2\pi R2 f_c}
\]
Example (R2 = 10 kΩ):

| Target fc | C2 (µF) |
|-----------|---------|
| 25 Hz     | 0.637   |
| 30 Hz     | 0.531   |
| 40 Hz     | 0.398   |
| 50 Hz     | 0.318   |
| 80 Hz     | 0.199   |

---

**Method 2: Keep C2 fixed, change R2**
\[
R2 = \frac{1}{2\pi C2 f_c}
\]
Example (C2 = 0.47 µF):

| Target fc | R2 (Ω) |
|-----------|--------|
| 25 Hz     | 13.55 kΩ |
| 33 Hz     | 10.26 kΩ |
| 40 Hz     | 8.47 kΩ |
| 50 Hz     | 6.77 kΩ |
| 80 Hz     | 4.23 kΩ |

---

**Method 3: Account for amplifier input impedance**
\[
R_{\text{eff}} = R2 \parallel R_{\text{in,amp}}
\]
\[
R2 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{\text{eff}}} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{in,amp}}}}
\]
Example: Want fc = 33.9 Hz with C2 = 0.47 µF → \(R_{\text{eff}}=10\text{k}\)  
If amp Rin = 47 kΩ → choose R2 ≈ 12.7 kΩ.

## 🛠️ Build Notes
- Use **film capacitors** for C2 (better stability and sound quality).
- Keep traces short and use a **ground plane** for best noise rejection.
- RCA jacks on input, 2-pin terminal block on output.
- Clearly label `OUT+` and `GND` on silkscreen.
- Recommended trace width: ≥ 0.5 mm for signal, ≥ 1 mm for ground.
